As much as computing is ubiquitous in our lives, it is effectively out of reach for many people:  Itâ€™s hard to understand and
hard to shape to personal needs.

This is an implementation of a morphoology-aware Kinyarwanda Language model (kinyaBERT) based on [this paper]([url](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08459)) 

## Improvements made:

# Morpohlogy disambiguation process: I
 - included neighborhood information in feature extraction

# Morphology Encoder:
- Embeddings were produced using a physics-inspired superposition of the morphemes embeddings (Tensorized embeddings)
